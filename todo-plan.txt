when the shoplist drop down is change get the browser to show the edit-shopping-list action.

css pretifying

items table
    order_by int default 1.
    the sql generating the lists of items would need to be modified.

items_order action.
    new view on items that allows the order_by to be set, using jQuery.

add_category action. New !
    can only add categories, ui will not allow renaming or deletion

add_shop action. New !
    can only add shops, ui will not allow renaming or deletion

edit_item action
    a way to set the shop prices.
    a way to set the items.order_by int.

    stop editting of item names that have more than one un-finalised-list referencing it. This is if I bother with "finalising" lists.


view_shopping_list action. new!
    jQuery, refresh the shopping list being viewed.

edit_shopping_list action

    jQuery, refresh the shopping list being editted.

Make a mobile friendly version (responsive)

Prices.
    in the shopping-list views :
        take the dearest shop price and summarise
        take the cheapest shop and summarise.

view_shopping_list_pdf action. new !
    generates a pdf version of the shopping list.
    Do I really need a PDF version ? The text one works in Linux.

make the printable shopping list usable in a windows text editor,
basically fix the line break characters.

################
Finalising lists
################
    Do I really want to do the "finalise" stuff ?

    edit_list
        finalise checkbox. has pop up warning, saying no editting afterwards.
            item names and prices are copied from items table into shopping_lists table.

    delete_finalised_list action. new !
        will error if a list hasn't been finalised.


    edit_shopping_list action

        will throw an error on a finalised shopping list.

        shopping_lists table, new fields :
            final_item_price
            final_item_name

            constraint that says either item_id or final_item_name is null, and one must be not null.



    the drop down box that selects the list, make jQuery hide/show the action buttons depending on if the list is finalised or not. i.e.
        Active Lists can
            Edit Shopping list
            Edit List
            be Printable
        Finalised Lists can be
            Printable
            Deleted.

BUGS
##########

If a shopping_list has shown-all-items set to false, and an item has a positive quantity set on it, then the item is set to be hidden, the item will then not show up in the shopping-list section. Not sure if this a bug or feature. Fixing it in the sql would be hard.
